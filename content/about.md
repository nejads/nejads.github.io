# Long Version

I'm a passionate programmer with a strong focus on AWS cloud engineering and Java backend development. Throughout my professional journey, I've found immense joy in crafting innovative solutions that harness the power of technology to solve real-world challenges.

## Technical Expertise

In my day-to-day work, I mainly utilize Java and Typescript, leveraging their robustness and versatility to build efficient and scalable applications. Additionally, I'm well-versed in script languages like Bash and Python, which I use to automate mundane and repetitive tasks, streamlining workflows and maximizing productivity.

## Educational Background

I pursued my academic interests in **Computer Systems and Networks** at **Chalmers University of Technology**, Sweden. The comprehensive knowledge I gained during my studies has provided a strong foundation for my career and allowed me to tackle complex technical problems with confidence.

## Professional Involvement

Being a firm believer in continuous learning and professional growth, I actively engage with the Java and Python communities. I regularly participate in meet-ups, conferences, and workshops to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements in these programming languages.

## Community Involvement

In my local community of Gothenburg, Sweden, I'm a follower of the OWASP community and various security communities. I find great value in understanding and addressing cybersecurity challenges to create a safer digital world.

## Passions Beyond Programming

Beyond the world of coding, I have a deep love for mathematics. Its elegance and problem-solving nature fascinate me, and I often find myself exploring mathematical concepts in my spare time.

As a way to connect with people and expand my horizons, I also indulge in literature and photography. Both mediums allow me to express my creativity and capture moments that tell compelling stories.

## Family and Nature

In addition to my professional pursuits, I'm incredibly proud to be a father of two wonderful children. They bring joy and meaning to my life, and I cherish every moment spent with them.

Outside of work and family life, I'm a nature enthusiast. Exploring the great outdoors, hiking in the mountains, and immersing myself in the beauty of the natural world are some of my favorite activities. There's something truly revitalizing about being surrounded by nature, and it provides a refreshing perspective that fuels my creativity and problem-solving abilities.

## Social and Humanitarian Values

I firmly believe in the importance of advocating for human rights, civil rights, and social action. Making a positive impact on society and empowering marginalized communities are causes close to my heart.
